Abivia\Configurable
====

This trait facilitates the conversion of a set of data structures, typically generated by
decoding JSON or YAML configuration files, into PHP classes. `Configurable`
has options for converting arrays of objects into associative arrays using a property of
the object. It can also validate inputs as well as guard and remap property names.

`Configurable` supports property mapping, gated properties (via allow, block, and ignore methods),
data validation, and data-driven class instantiation. It will map arrays of objects to
associative arrays of PHP classes that are indexed by any unique scalar property in the object.

Loading can be either fault-tolerant or strict. Strict validation can either fail with a
`false` result or by throwing the `Exception` class of your choice.

Basic Usage
----

- Implement `configureClassMap()` for the top level class and any properties that map to your classes.
- Add the configurable trait to your classes.
- Instantiate the top level class and pass your decoded JSON or YAML to the `configure()` method.

Basic example:
```php
class ConfigurableObject {
    use \Abivia\Configurable\Configurable;

    protected $userName;
    protected $password;

}
$json = '{"userName": "admin"; "password": "insecure"]';
$obj = new ConfigurableObject();
$obj -> configure(json_decode($json));
echo $obj -> userName . ', ' . $obj -> password;
```
Output:
admin, insecure


Advanced Usage
---

- If you need to map properties, implement `configurePropertyMap()` where needed.
- Add property validation by implementing `configureValidate()`.
- Gate access to properties by implementing any of `configurePropertyAllow()`,
  `configurePropertyBlock()` or `configurePropertyIgnore()`.
- You can also initialize the class instance at run time with `configureInitialize()`.
- Semantic validation of the result can be performed at the end of the loading process by
  implementing `configureComplete()`.

Filtering
-----
The properties of the configured object can be explicitly permitted by overriding the
`configurePropertyAllow()` method, blocked by overriding the `configurePropertyBlock()`
method, or ignored via the `configurePropertyIgnore()` method. Ignore takes precedence, then
blocking, then allow. By default, attempts to set guarded properties
are ignored, but if the $strict parameter is either true or the name of a `Throwable`
class, then the configuration will terminate when the invalid parameter is encountered,
unless it has been explicitly ignored.

For a JSON input like this
```json
{
    "depth": 15,
    "length": 22,
    "primary: "Red",
    "width": 3
}
```

with a class that does not have the `primary` property, the result depends on the
`strict` argument:
```php
    class SomeClass {
        use \Abivia\Configurable;

        protected $depth;
        protected $length;
        protected $width;

    }

    $obj = new SomeClass();
    // Returns true
    $obj -> configure($jsonDecoded);
    // Lazy validation: Returns true
    $obj -> configure($jsonDecoded, false);
    // Strict validation: Returns false
    $obj -> configure($jsonDecoded, true);
    // Strict validation: throws MyException
    $obj -> configure($jsonDecoded, 'MyException');
 ```

Initialization and Completion
---
In many cases it is required that the object be in a known state before configuration,
and that the configured object has acceptable values. `Configurable` supplies
`configureInitialize()` and `configureComplete()` for this purpose. `configureInitialize()`
can be used to return a previously instantiated object to a known state.



Validation
---
Scalar properties can be validated with `configureValidate()`. This method takes
the property name and the input value as arguments.
The value is passed by reference so that the validation can enforce specific formats
required by the object (for example by forcing case or cleaning out unwanted characters).

The `configureComplete()` method provides a mechanism for object level validation. For
example, this method could be used to validate a set of access credentials, logging an
error or aborting the configuration process entirely if they are not valid.

Property Name Mapping
---
Since configuration files allow properties that are not valid PHP property names,
`configurePropertyMap()` can be used to convert illegal input properties to valid
PHP identifiers.

```php
protected function configurePropertyMap($property) {
    if ($property[0] == '$') {
        $property = 'dollar_' . substr($property, 1);
    }
    return $property;
}
```

Contained Classes
---
`configureClassMap()` can be used to cause the instantiation and configuration
of classes that are contained within the top level class. These contained classes must provide
the `configure()` method, either of their own making or by also adopting the `Configurable`
trait.

`configureClassMap()` takes the name and value of a property as arguments and returns:

- the name of a class to be instantiated and configured, or
- an object that has a required `className` property and an optional `key` property.

### className
In the simplest case, `className` is the
name of a class that will be instantiated and configured. However, `className` may also be
a callable that takes the current property value as an argument.
This allows the creation of data-specific object classes.

### key
The `key` property is optional and tells Configurable to populate an array.

 - if `key` is absent or blank, the constructed object is appended to the array,
 - if `key` is a string, then it is taken as the name of a property or method (if
`keyIsMethod` is true) in the constructed object, and this value is used as the
key for an associative array, and
 - if `key` is a callable array, then it is called with the object under construction
as an argument.

### keyIsMethod
The `keyIsMethod` property is only used when `key` is present and not a callable. When
set, `key` is treated as a method of the constructed object. Typically this is a getter.
